MFR is a novel adversary detection mechanism based on the multi-channel feature redistribution, which disentangles the initial embedded features into three channels: (1) core feature - it guarantees the robustness and the precision of classification; (2) co-activation feature - it causes the prediction into the adjacent category; and (3) background noise - it makes the distribution chaotic.
